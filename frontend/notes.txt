To Do's 
///////////////////////////

1. Email Removal
- If a user submits a form without an email address, after previously having one ,
a warning modal will show up informing the user that they will be removing their email if they submit the form 
- allows for users to submit form without filling out an email field 

2. Checkboxes
- right now, checkboxes are not aligned with filter state. 
- goal is to have checkboxes in sync with filter state and keep their state
between renders of the filter ul component
- ** Chnage data structure from using a records array to a records object
so we can access keys directly instead of looping through an array for updates to checkboxes 
. Furthermore, we will restrict the unecessary data 
- Current efficiency is O(N) 
- Updated datastructure will yield O(1)

3. Finish testing 
- finish e2e testing
- create component tests if wanting any practice with that 

4. Add more to landing page 
- add an engageing and pleasant content to the landing page for viewers to understand the gist of the site 
and also see beautiful engaging photos 

5. Add form validation to login and register components
